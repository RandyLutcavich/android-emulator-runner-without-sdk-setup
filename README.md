# GitHub Action - Android Emulator Runner (Without SDK Setup)


Check the original README for more details: [ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner)

This fork has one purpose: To not install Android SDk and all the required tools because they already exist on the machine.
Side benefit, this fork doesn't require your machine to have sudo.
